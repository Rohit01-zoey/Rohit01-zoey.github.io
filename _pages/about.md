I am a **second-year M.S. in Computer Science** student at **Duke University**. 

My research interests lie closely in robustness and reasoning in LLMs. I am specifically interested in learning more about how models reason and improve it at the same time. At the same time I want to ensure that they are efficient and scalable in real life.

I am currently advised by **[Prof. Bhuwan Dhingra](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~bdhingra/)** at **Duke**, where I am currently exploring mathematical reasoning of multi-modal LLMs

Previously, I interned at **[CERT Labs](https://github.com/CERT-Lab)**, where I worked under **[Prof. Praneeth Vepakomma](https://sites.mit.edu/praneeth/)** at **Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI)**, where my focus was on **improving efficiency of LLMs**.  

Additionally, I was also advised by **[Prof. Monica Agrawal](https://www.monicaagrawal.com/)** at **Duke University**, where I worked on **studying and improving medical chatbots** to enhance their accuracy and real-world usability.  

Feel free to explore my work and reach out! ðŸš€
