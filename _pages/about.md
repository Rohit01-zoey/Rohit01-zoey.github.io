I am a **second-year M.S. student in Computer Science** at **Duke University**.  

I am currently part of **[CERT Labs](https://github.com/CERT-Lab)**, working under **[Prof. Praneeth Vepakomma](https://sites.mit.edu/praneeth/)** at **Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI)**, where my focus is on **reducing the memory utilization of large language models (LLMs)**.  

Additionally, I am advised by **[Prof. Monica Agrawal](https://www.monicaagrawal.com/)** at **Duke University**, where I work on **studying and improving medical chatbots** to enhance their accuracy and real-world usability.  

Still figuring out what truly excites me, but Iâ€™ll probably update this when I do! ðŸ«   

Feel free to explore my work and reach out! ðŸš€
