Hello,

I am a fifth-year undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, pursuing Electrical Engineering with a specialization in Machine Learning.

My research experience has taught me how important it is for machine learning technoilogies to work well in real life, not just in theory. I'm particularly interested in making sure that ML algorithms are reliable, easy to use on a large scale, and fair.

Currently, I am working under the supervison of Prof. [Ganesh Ramakrishnan](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ganesh/) at IIT Bombay and [Pradeep Shenoy](https://sites.google.com/site/pshenoyuw/) at Google Research, India.
