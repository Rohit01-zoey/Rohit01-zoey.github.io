I am a **second-year M.S. in Computer Science** student at **Duke University**.

My research interests lie in **robustness and reasoning in LLMs**. I am particularly interested in understanding how models reason, improving that reasoning process, and ensuring that these models remain **efficient and scalable in real-world settings**.

I am currently advised by **[Prof. Bhuwan Dhingra](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~bdhingra/)** at **Duke**, where I am exploring the **mathematical reasoning capabilities of multimodal LLMs**.

Previously, I interned at **[CERT Labs](https://github.com/CERT-Lab)**, working under **[Prof. Praneeth Vepakomma](https://sites.mit.edu/praneeth/)** at **Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI)**, where my focus was on **improving the efficiency and scalability of large language models**.

Additionally, I was advised by **[Prof. Monica Agrawal](https://www.monicaagrawal.com/)** at **Duke University**, where I worked on **studying and improving medical chatbots** to enhance their accuracy and real-world usability.

Feel free to explore my work and reach out! ðŸš€
