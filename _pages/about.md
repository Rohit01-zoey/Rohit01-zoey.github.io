Hello,

I am a fifth-year undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, pursuing Electrical Engineering with a specialization in Machine Learning.

My research interests lie in meta-learning and active distillation, focusing on developing algorithms with broad applicability in real-world scenarios.

Currently, I am working under the mentorship of Prof. Ganesh Ramakrishnan at IIT Bombay, in collaboration with Pradeep Shenoy at Google Research, India.
