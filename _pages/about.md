Hi, I am a Fifth year undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay.  I am pursuing my Electrical Engineering with a specialization in Machine Learning.

My research interests include meta-learning and active distillation. I want to create algorithms which span the breadth of machine learning wih a special focus on their real world applicability.
