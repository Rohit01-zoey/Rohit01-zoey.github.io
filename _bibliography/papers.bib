  abstract  = {People are increasingly seeking healthcare information from large language models (LLMs) via interactive chatbots, yet the nature and inherent risks of these conversations remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we filter large-scale conversational AI datasets to achieve HealthChat-11K, a curated dataset of 11K real-world conversations composed of 25K user messages. We use HealthChat-11K and a clinician-driven taxonomy for how users interact with LLMs when seeking healthcare information in order to systematically study user interactions across 21 distinct health specialties. Our analysis reveals insights into the nature of how and why users seek health information, such as common interactions, instances of incomplete context, affective behaviors, and interactions (e.g., leading questions) that can induce sycophancy, underscoring the need for improvements in the healthcare support capabilities of LLMs deployed as conversational AI. We release code and artifacts to retrieve our analyses and combine them into a curated dataset for further research.}

abstract="In-memory on-chip learning is crucial for low-power, in-field training capabilities at the edge. We demonstrate the robustness of on-chip back-propagation to hardware variability in terms of bit-cell transistor {\$}{\$}V{\_}T{\$}{\$}variability ({\$}{\$}2.5{\backslash}times {\$}{\$}more robust than off-chip training). We use perturbation schemes, asymmetry variations and variability-aware update schemes to identify the relative contribution of different on-chip operations: forward pass, backward pass and weight updates to Fashion-MNIST classification performance degradation with variations. It is revealed that variability during the weight update step is crucial while accuracy of backward pass or gradient calculation is not critical. We promote weight perturbation scheme over back-propagation as the choice for on-chip in-memory training with reduced points of failure and low cost of hardware.",

  abstract          = {In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
